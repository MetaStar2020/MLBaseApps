## Motivation

The purpose of this folder is to demonstrate my abilities as an mobile app developer/engineer in AI and Machine Learning using Swift CoreML.

Areas of focus: <strong> VISION, CoreML, SWIFTUI, UIViewControllerRepresentable (importing storyboard-related UI) </strong>

Architecture: <strong> Model-View-Controller (MVC) </strong>

## 1. Face Detection

This app uses image analysistechniques to count faces in an image and perform various actions with that information, such as applying other images on top of the face, with the correct rotation. 

### Features

- [x] SWIFTUI
- [x] VNFaceObservation (CoreML VISION) <i> - Recognizing face or facial features in an image </i>
- [x] Taking control of UIImage to do advanced modifications 

## 2. Barcode Detection

This app uses Apple's frameworks to find barcodes in images.

### Features

- [x] VNRectangleObservation and VNBarcodeObservation (CoreML VISION)  <i> - Recognizing rectangles and barcodes in an image </i>
- [x] Manipulating the standard CGRect class

## Requirements

• iOS 13.2+

• XCode 12+
